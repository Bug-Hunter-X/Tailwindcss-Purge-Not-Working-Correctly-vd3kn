# Tailwindcss Purge Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug related to Tailwind CSS's purge functionality.  Some classes are unexpectedly missing from the final CSS output, resulting in styling issues.  The solution showcases how to correctly configure purging to resolve the problem. 

## Bug Description

The `purge` option in Tailwind CSS is not correctly identifying and including all necessary CSS classes, leading to missing styles in the production build.  This often occurs when using dynamic class names or when there's a mismatch between the content processed by the purge and the actual classes used in the application.  The bug manifests as missing styles or unexpected rendering of components.
